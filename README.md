# podcatch
Goals:
- user can add any podcast RSS feed URLs to the app, including with auth
- user can listen to podcasts from added feeds in the app
- user can easily build playlists or queues of content they've added
- user can organize the content they've added
- user can easily search the content they've added

That is literally all. Is it so much to ask for?
